Hi\! My name is Shawn Hermans. I live, work, and play in Omaha, NE with my 
wife, [Jammie Hermans](http://jammiehermans.blogspot.com/), my four kids, Parker,
Regan, Jabe, and Dexter, and our dog Tori.  

I have wore many hats in my professional life.  Those include mathematician, data architect,
programmer, project manager, consultant, operations researcher, data engineer, and data scientist.  

When you strip away those roles and titles, 
I am just one more person trying to make some sense of this world.  For me that means looking 
through data from multiple sources and points of view.  Data comes in all sorts of different forms.
Sometimes that data is stored on HDFS in a Hadoop cluster, other times it is in a book or a song.  

Ultimately, I realize no matter how much data I look through, I am never going to understand it all. 
This quote [Isaac Newton](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/i/isaacnewto387031.html#dkKzj7bkTlQGJkAW.99)
describes my feelings much better than I could. 

> I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been 
> only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then 
> finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst 
> the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.

This blog is my way of sharing the shiny things I find with the world.  I 
hope you enjoy them as much as I do!
