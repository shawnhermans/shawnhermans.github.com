title: About Me
---
Hi\! My name is Shawn Hermans. I live, work, and play in Omaha, NE with my 
wife, [Jammie Hermans](http://jammiehermans.blogspot.com/), my four kids, Parker,
Regan, Jabe, and Dexter, and our dogs Tori and Alfred.  

I have worn many hats in my professional life.  Those include mathematician, data architect,
programmer, project manager, consultant, operations researcher, data engineer, and data scientist.  

Ultimately, I realize no matter how much I learn in life, I am never going to understand it all. 
This quote by [Isaac Newton](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/i/isaacnewto387031.html#dkKzj7bkTlQGJkAW.99)
describes my feelings much better than I could. 

> I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been 
> only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then 
> finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst 
> the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.

This blog is my way of sharing the shiny things I find with the world.  I 
hope you enjoy them as much as I do!
