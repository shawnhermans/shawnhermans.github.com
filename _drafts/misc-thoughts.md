## Corporate Culture

Why do they use tools like Informatica, Oracle, etc...? 

## Complexity
Complexity kills

## Automation

Informatica, Talend, etc...

Excel, Word, Powerpoint, etc...

These tools are very user friendly, but limit the ability to automate. 

Eric Raymond's [How to become a hacker](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#attitude) 

1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.
2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.
3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.
4. Freedom is good.
5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.


Examples

Word Processing 
I used to do all my blogging in 

## Closed Source Shops
Its about information.  Only way to get information is from the vendor.  
Often make users sign agreements not to publish 

## Common Metadata Container

## Limitations of Relational 

Data extraction from raw forms of data


Maps/Associative arrays

I realize some relational database are starting to support these types. 

Not everything is a query

## Data Science is the Devops of Data

When people talk about data science, they are usually talking about two different types of people. 
One is more of a traditional statistician.  The other is an engineer. 

Data science is part of a larger trend of software engineering best practices 
crossing over into other disciplines. 

Its really just a trend towards automation. 

Devops

IT is hacker culture infecting other areas

## Difference between Data Mining, Analytics and Data Science

## When do you separate your systems?

When does tight coupling become the problem?

## Visual Tools
Informatica is a drag and drop drop tool. 

I used to be hyper critical of tools like Informatica.  But the old maxim, 10% of the time is spent 
writing the code and 90% of the time is spent maintaining the code rings a certain amount of truth. 

Tools like Informatica constrain the user.  



## Limits of Centralization
I see the tendency to want to centralize.  Centralization is about shared capital, knowledge and culture.  

This is one of the reasons open source software development works so well.  There is typically very little 
capital required (as opposed to a railroad, construction company, etc..) and information is easily shared via the 
internet. 

## Leaderless Organizations
Something within human mind to seek a leader.  A personification of an idea.  

## Standardizatation
Related to centralization.  When to standardize and when to not.  

Follow the principle of never solve the same problem twice with emphasis on "the same problem".  

## What is Big Data Really About?
We have Teradata.  Its big data, but it isn't Big Data. 

Software/System Engineering + Math/Stats + Data 

Don't throw anything away

Keep it raw
