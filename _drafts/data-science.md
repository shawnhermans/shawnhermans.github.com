Why I don't data science

I really feel it is important to call things by their proper name.  

In particular, I have fondness for science and I don't like seeing the term 
misused.  



http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist

> A scientist, in a broad sense, is one engaging in a systematic activity to acquire 
> knowledge. In a more restricted sense, a scientist may refer to an 
> individual who uses the scientific method.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer

> An engineer is a professional practitioner of engineering, concerned with applying scientific knowledge, 
> mathematics, and ingenuity to develop solutions for technical, societal and commercial problems. 

Both engineers and scientists are equally valuable in contributing to society.
