title: "Information Mental Model"

tags: [information, mental models]

Borrowing some ideas from information theory, statistics, and machine learning and applying them to human 
interactions. 

What is a mental model? 

What does this model help explain?

* Encoding
* Decoding
* Transmission
* Noisy channels
* Information resolves uncertainity
* Encryption

It also explains why we have sex.  DNA encodes information.  Sex allows useful mutations to spread more rapidly through the species and allows deleterious mutations to be cleared more rapidly.  

[Physical information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_information) distinguish between states.  If system A has N states and system B has M states, the combined systems have information I(AB) = log(NM) = log(N) + log(M).  

Entropy - Amount of information that is missing before reception of the message. Measure of the unpredictability of information content.  Low entropy systems are predictable, whereas high entropy systems are not.  Entropy is also related to redudancy.  

A message is an event or sample drawn from a data stream.  

I thought of calling it "information", but the word was overly used, so I decided to call it "uncertainty". [...] Von Neumann told me, "You should call it entropy, for two reasons. In the first place your uncertainty function has been used in statistical mechanics under that name, so it already has a name. In the second place, and more important, nobody knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage."

Messages 

Belief - Internal state that guides actions in response to inputs
Learning - Updating beliefs based upon external and internal inputs
Information - Neutral.  People take the same information and form different beliefs.  
Communication
Culture - Shared set of beliefs

## Examples

Introverts and extroverts have fundamentally different learning algorithms.  Introverts take information 
from the outside world and process it internally in order to form beliefs.
