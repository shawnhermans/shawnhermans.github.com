## Core Concepts

Belief - Internal state that guides actions in response to inputs
Learning - Updating beliefs based upon external and internal inputs
Information - Neutral.  People take the same information and form different beliefs.  
Communication
Culture - Shared set of beliefs

## Introverts and Extroverts

Introverts and extroverts have fundamentally different learning algorithms.  Introverts take information 
from the outside world and process it internally in order to form beliefs.
