I want to start out by saying that I am not opposed to the idea of selling software for money.  
While I admire Richard Stallman and his noble cause of Free Software, I am not a true believer.  

I am not a fan of visual programming or design tools.  

The decision whether or not to use a graphical tool really boils down to whether or not you 
have, or want, a strong engineering staff.  

What does "Enterprise Ready" mean? 

It all comes down to information.  

Are the people doing the analysis actually using the tools? 

# The Bad
Lotus Notes, Informatica, 

# Vendor Tools Done Right
