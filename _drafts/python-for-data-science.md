  It’s like the old saying, “To the man with only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.” And of course, that’s the way
  the chiropractor goes about practicing medicine. But that’s a perfectly disastrous way to think and a perfectly disastrous
  way to operate in the world. So you’ve got to have multiple models.

[Which is better for data analysis: R or Python?](http://www.quora.com/Which-is-better-for-data-analysis-R-or-Python)

SAS, Matlab, Mathematica, Maple

Ruby, Groovy, Perl, etc...

Groovy
Just isn't as popular among data scientists.

[Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

"Python is fast enough for our site and allows us to produce maintainable features in record times, with a minimum of developers," said Cuong Do, Software Architect, YouTube.com.
