Yesterday I gave an introductory talk on Big Data to 
the [Heartland Big Data Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/Heartland-Big-Data-Meetup/). There was a great 
turnout for the talk. I had a lot of fun talking with so many people with an 
interest in Big Data.  I posted the slides on [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/shawnhermans/thinking-big-37110886)
if you want to take a look.
